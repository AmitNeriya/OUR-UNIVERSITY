    private universities and public universities are providing higher education, and both have some positive and negative aspects. One great advantage of the public universities is that students can get an education with a minimal cost because Govt. provides financial support here. Also, there are qualified teachers in Public universities, and it is likely that students get quality education from here. However, the negative side in these universities is the political violence that leads to closure and session jam. The most important positive aspect of a private university is that there is no political violence and session jam in private universities. Therefore, students can complete their courses in due time. But one negative side is that there have been mushrooming of private universities in Bangladesh, and some universities simply sell certificates. It is hoped that the overall objectives of both private and public universities should be to provide quality education.
