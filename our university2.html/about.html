    <h2 class="amit1">Ranked No. 14 on the 2018 Academic Ranking of World Universities, the University of Washington educates more than 54,000 students each year. Its mission is to turn ideas into positive impact, an ideology that’s rooted in deep optimism and a hunger to pursue progress.

        UW offers a well-designed college website that houses plenty of information relating to its core mission. While they offer value through several elements on their site, two that stand out include:
        
        Well-designed donation page. When alumni and other supporters want to express their support for the school, they often turn to the institution’s donation page. UW leverages this opportunity with a well-designed donation page, broken into three easy steps: selecting a suggested donation amount, entering contact details, and submitting payment information. A CMS like Morweb simplifies the form creation process by offering numerous customization options and allowing you to collect payment directly through your site.
        
        Prominent icons. On the homepage, visitors are immediately drawn to the icons that are designed to direct users to important parts of the website. There’s an engagement opportunity for a range of visitors who land on the site, whether they’re looking to engage with the school on social media, explore a map of the main campus, or get an inside look at the school’s athletic teams and schedules.
        Whether you’re an alumnus looking to support your alma mater or a high school student athlete deciding which school you’ll take your talent to, the UW makes sure you have all the information you need on their college website.
